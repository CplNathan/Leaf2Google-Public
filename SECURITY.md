## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is a community project, as such there are no formal rewards or bug bounties for reporting vulnerabilities. Vulnerability reporting is done out of your own good will. You can expect attribution for any vulnerabilities/contributions.

If you find a vulnerability please report it to me directly or by creating a private issue/pull-request.
