## Want to do's:
* Charging scheduler
* Climate scheduler
* Decipher the SRP setup so that remote lock/unlocking is possible
* Route planner and range visualizer
* More?

## Why?
I wanted a way to heat my car up in the morning. Nissan supports scheduling heating or cooling through the car's interface, however, this is a scheduled time. I wanted to be able to integrate this into my assistants good morning routine which is something Nissan currently does not offer. Since then I have continued to take the web portion of this project further as a bit of a challenge and to familiarise myself with some newer technologies.
